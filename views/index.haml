    Got stuck on Text Twist&trade; or Every Word&trade;?  Stumped on Scrabble&reg;?
    Or maybe you just want help finding that bingo to cheat your poor Mom at Words with
    Friends&reg; (admit it!).

    Just enter the letters you have and the spaces to fill in the form to the left,
    and we'll help you out.

    Note: this handy tool uses publically available spellchecking dictionaries, so
    I don't guarantee that it uses the exact same word list as any particular
    word game.  Coming soon: the ability to change which dictionary you'd like
    to search!
